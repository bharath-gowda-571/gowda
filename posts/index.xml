      <description>Do you want to become a cricketer in India? I have a secret tip for you. If you&amp;rsquo;re born in September, October, November, or December, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck. Unfortunately, if you&amp;rsquo;re not born in any of these months, it might be tough. Perhaps consider timing the birth of your child for one of these months. You might be wondering how being born in these months increases the chances of becoming a cricketer.</description>

      <description>What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&amp;rsquo;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</description>
